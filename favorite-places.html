    <h2>These are a few of my favorite places!</h2>

    <h3>Oh the places you (won't) go!</h3>
    <p>Everyone says they love to travel, and I'm no exception. This year
      has been a particularly wander-ful one. Here are just a few of the far-flung 
      locales I've had the joy to explore in 2020:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The living room</li>
      <li>The backyard</li>
      <li>Video game Egypt</li>
      <li>Kroger shopping center</li>
      <li>The depths of personal and professional despair</li>
    </ul>

    <P>Wow, what a trip!</P>
    <p>I wonder where the rest of this incredible year will take me...</p>
