    <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
    <h2>These are a few of my favorite places!</h2>

    <h3>Oh the places you (won't) go!</h3>
    <p>Everyone says they love to travel, and I'm no exception. This year
      has been a particularly wander-ful one. Here are just a few of the far-flung 
      locales I've had the joy to explore in 2020:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The living room</p>
        <img src="img/living.jpg" alt="A photo of a boring living room."></li>
      <li><p>The backyard</p>
        <img src="img/backyard.jpg" alt="A photo of someone else's backyard."></li>
      <li><p>Video game Egypt</p>
        <img src="img/egypt.jpg" alt="A photo of Egyptian wall art."></li>
      <li><p>Kroger shopping center</p>
        <img src="img/grocery.jpg" alt="A photo of the only place I can go that isn't my house."></li>
      <li><p>The depths of personal and professional crisis</p>
        <img src="img/quarantine.jpg" alt="A photo of 2020."></li>
    </ul>

    <P>Wow, what a trip!</P>
    <p>I wonder where the rest of this unpredictable year will take me...</p>
